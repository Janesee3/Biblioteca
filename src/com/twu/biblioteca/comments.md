\# Code review comments

### Good
- good use of enums to create readable constants
- good separation of concerns (in Parser, Store, UI, etc)

### Could be improved
- The size of Logic class suggests it's doing too many things (has too many responsibilities) and could be broken down into smaller classes
- Would Logic be better named as Controller?

### Questions
